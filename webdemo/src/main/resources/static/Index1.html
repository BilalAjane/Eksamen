<h2>Good Hyper-V info</h2>
<p>Hyper-V needs hardware virtualization as prerequisite. <br>
    Make sure your PC supports it, if yes and still won't work there is the possibility your BIOS is not configured correctly and this feature is disabled. <br>
    In this case, check, enable it and try again. The virtualization features could be reported under different names according the platform used <br>
    (e.g if you don't see any option that uses virtualization label explicitly, on AMD you have to check SVM feature state, on Intel the VT-x feature state).
